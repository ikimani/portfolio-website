    <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate and curious tech learner exploring the worlds of web development, digital forensics, and cybersecurity.
    With a strong sense of creativity and a deep desire to solve real-world problems, I find joy in understanding how
    technology works and how it can be used to drive positive change. My goal is to become a <strong>full-stack software developer</strong>
    and <strong>digital forensic expert</strong> — someone who not only builds meaningful digital tools and experiences but also
    uses technology to uncover truth, protect data, and contribute to justice.

<!-- SECTION 3: Programming Languages -->
<section id="languages">
    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
    <p>I began learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python at the start of July 2025. I’m currently learning through the Power Learn Project classes and YouTube tutorials. My goal is to become a full-stack software developer, so I’m focusing on both front-end and back-end development. While I’ve started with front-end technologies, I’m also building a strong foundation in Python for back-end. By the end of August, I aim to be confident in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So far, I’ve built two projects that showcase my progress and passion for software development.

  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Forensic Science</strong> at <strong>Kenyatta University</strong> and entering my third year in September 2025. In addition to my formal education, I'm also actively expanding my tech skills through the <strong>Power Learn Project (PLP)</strong> as part of the July 2025 cohort. Here, I'm studying <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, while supplementing my learning with YouTube tutorials. Although I don't have any tech certifications yet, I am working toward them as I progress.
    <br><br>
    My long-term goal is to become both a <strong>Full-Stack Software Developer</strong> and a <strong>Digital Forensic Scientist</strong>, combining my academic background in forensic science with my passion for technology. I also plan to explore <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> in-depth after mastering the core web development stack.

<!-- SECTION 5: Interests -->
<section id="interests">
  <h1>Interests</h1>
   <p>
      Outside the tech space, I have a deep love for crime TV shows, which naturally aligns with my pursuit of a Bachelor’s degree in Forensic Science. This passion strongly influences my long-term goal of becoming a digital forensic scientist. I also enjoy dancing — especially salsa, kizomba, and bachata — as a way to stay active and expressive. Journaling is another important part of my life, helping me reflect on both my personal and tech learning journey. Whether I’m solving puzzles or exploring new concepts online, I find joy in challenges that sharpen my thinking. These interests not only recharge me but also fuel my drive to grow as a well-rounded full-stack developer and digital investigator.

    <h2>🎬 Movie Tracker</h2>
    <p>
      I love watching movies and bingeing shows — it’s honestly my favorite thing to do when I’m not learning or studying. So I made this Movie Tracker as a fun way to list the shows and movies I’ve watched recently. I kept it simple but made sure it felt like <em>me</em> — colorful, clean, and easy to scroll through.

    <h2>🕵🏽‍♀️ Digital Crime Scene Report</h2>
    <p>
      This project was inspired by two things: my dream of becoming a digital forensic scientist, and the fact that I’m actually studying forensic science at university. I wanted to build something different — not just another portfolio piece, but something that connected to who I am. The layout looks like a real investigation dashboard, with case overviews and evidence logs. Simple? Yes. But personal? Absolutely.

      This website is where everything comes together — my interests, my background, and my style. I went with a dark background, added neon colors, and used a touch of accent pink (because why not?). It’s clean, modern, and fully coded by me using just HTML and CSS.
